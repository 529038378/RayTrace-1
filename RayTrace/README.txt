1. To compile the program, use attached "makefile" in a command line tool or import codes in a new c++ project
2. Running the generated executable program raytrace.exe, the usage is as below:
	Usage: raytrace.exe <output_img>
	       <output_img>: PPM file

Notes: pic1.ppm used two lighting sources { 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f }, { 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f }, while pic2.ppm used two different lighting sources 
{ 0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f }, { 0.7f, 0.0f, 0.0f }. Also, pic1.ppm used the viewpoint at { 0.0, 1.0, 0.0 } and pic2.ppm used the viewpoint at 
{ 0.0, 0.0, 6.0 }.
